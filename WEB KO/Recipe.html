				<h5 class="card-title"><strong>Beef Stroganoff</strong></h5>
				<p class="card-text">It is a luxurious dish of tender strips of beef, sautéed in a rich and creamy sauce made with cream, mushrooms, and onions. The flavors of the beef, mushrooms, and onions are perfectly balanced, and the sour cream (substituted with all purpose cream) gives it a tangy and rich finish. Imagine taking a forkful of the beef and mushrooms, with a creamy and savory sauce, and letting the flavors melt in your mouth. The dish is often served over a bed of egg noodles, which soak up the delicious sauce and make each bite even more delectable. I like mine served with mashed potatoes on the side or just plain, perfectly cooked white rice. This dish is ideal for the "bed weather" and will undoubtedly warm you from the inside out.<br>
		
					Here is my recipe for you to try at home:<br>
					
					Ingredients:<br>
					
					* 1/2 kg beef tenderloin or sirloin steak<br>
					* Salt and pepper to taste<br>
					* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour<br>
					* 2 tablespoons butter<br>
					* 1 onion, finely chopped<br>
					* Canned mushrooms, sliced<br>
					* 4 cloves of garlic, minced<br>
					* 2 cups beef stock<br>
					* 1 cup all-purpose cream<br>
					
					Instructions:<br>
					
					1 Cut the beef into thin strips and season with salt and pepper. <br>
					2 Dredge the beef in flour. In a large skillet, heat the butter over medium-high heat. <br>
					3 Add the beef and sauté for 2-3 minutes, or until browned. <br>
					4 Add the onion, mushrooms, and garlic and sauté for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. <br>
					5 Stir in the beef broth and bring it to a simmer. <br>
					6 Cook just enough until the meat is tender and the sauce has thickened. <br>
					7 Remove from the heat and stir in the all-purpose cream. <br>
					8 Serve the beef stroganoff, garnish with fresh parsley or chives if desired. I also added some crispy garlic on top.<br>

				<h5 class="card-title">Beef Tapa Recipe</h5>
				<p class="card-text">My recipe for Beef tapa is a mouth-watering dish that will transport your taste buds straight to Calatagan, Batangas (where my roots reside). This thinly sliced beef is marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, garlic, and spices, then pan-fried to perfection for a smoky, savory flavor that will make your taste buds sing.<br>

					To make this dish, you'll need:<br>
					
					* 1 lb thinly sliced beef (sirloin or flank steak work well)<br>
					* 1/4 cup soy sauce<br>
					* 1/4 cup calamansi juice (or lemon juice)<br>
					* 1/4 cup brown sugar<br>
					* 1 head of garlic, minced<br>
					* 1 tsp ground black pepper<br>
					* 1/2 tsp paprika<br>
					
					Instructions:<br>
					
					1 To prepare the beef tapa, begin by combining soy sauce, calamansi juice, brown sugar, garlic, black pepper, salt, and paprika in a large bowl. <br>
					2 Add the beef to the marinade, ensuring each piece is completely covered. Seal the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight for best results. <br>
					3 Next, heat the pan to a high temperature. Pan-fry the beef for 2-3 minutes per side or until it reaches your desired level of doneness. <br>
					4 Serve the beef tapa with steamed white rice, and for added texture, consider serving it with some stir-fried vegetables. Garnish with some sesame seeds.<br>
					5 Each bite of this dish will offer a bold and savory flavor, a smoky char from the maillard, and the tenderness of the beef. <br>
